Description of Methods:

16S microbiome extraction and sequencing
Degraded mangrove leaves were collected during the summers of 2013 and 2015 in Key Largo Florida from five different locations (Supplemental Figure 1A). Leaves were immediately stored at -20C until further processing. DNA was extracted using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mobio) following the manufacturer protocol. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified using the 515F (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGCGGTAA) - 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) primer pair (50). Sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) on an Illumina MiSeq with 300 bp paired-end run mode. Reads were analyzed using Qiime2 (ver. 2021.4). Reads were initially processed by JGI according to their iTag analysis protocol, followed by additional processing and analysis. Briefly, read trimming, filtering, and denoising were performed with the Dada2 plugin of Qiime2 (Callahan et al. 2016). Taxonomic assignment was performed with ‘feature-classifier classify-sklearn’, using the Naïve Bayes classifier trained on the Silva_138_99%_505F/806R region specific database (Bokulich et al.) Visualizations were performed with Qiime2R (ver. 0.99.6).
